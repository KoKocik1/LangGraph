# Reflection Agent

This project aims to facilitate the creation of enhanced responses through critical analysis and revision, implemented with the help of language models and structured tools. It's designed for developers or researchers involved in natural language processing, particularly those working on question answering systems.

## Overview
Reflection Agent is a Python-based tool that leverages AI models and structured query tools to enhance the process of generating and revising answers. It's intended for applications in domains requiring in-depth analysis and elaboration of responses, such as academic research or specialized customer support.

## Getting Started
To get started with Reflection Agent:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. Configure the environment variables by copying `reflexion-agent/.env.example` to `.env` and setting the appropriate values.

## Usage
To use Reflection Agent, run the following command:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```
### Example
Here's what executing the main script might look like:
```python
# Example of invoking the tool
result = chain.invoke(input={"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Write about AI-Powered SOC / autonomous soc problem domain, list startups that do that and raised capital.")]})
print(result)
```
## Project Structure
```

├── chains.py
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── schemas.py
└── tool_executor.py
```
## Project Details
Reflection Agent consists of several modules each responsible for a specific aspect of the tool:
- `schemas.py` defines data structures.
- `chains.py` sets up the processing chains.
- `main.py` serves as the entry point for running the chains.
- `tool_executor.py` contains logic for executing structured tool queries.

## When to Use This Project
Use Reflection Agent when you need to systematically improve responses based on critiques and structured revisions. It is not suitable for real-time response generation due to its iterative nature.

## Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Comprehensive response revision | Slower than direct answer generation |
| Structured and traceable modifications | Requires initial setup of tools and environment |

## Future Improvements
| Improvement | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Integration with more diverse data sources | To enhance the accuracy and depth of responses |
| Improved UI for non-technical users | To make the tool more accessible |
